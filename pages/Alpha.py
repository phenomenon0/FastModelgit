                    assistant:Player Breakdown:
                    Above average 19.8% usage (60th percentile) forward who plays 28.6 mpg averaging 11.6 points per contest on 58.3% TS% (77th percentile). 
                    Very active on both offensive (2.2 ORB‚Äôs per game) and defensive (3.7 DRB‚Äôs per game) glass. 
                    Most efficient scoring the ball in transition (1.333 PPP) and offensive rebounding situations (1.271 PPP).
                    Majority of his work is done inside the arc as seen with his below average 15.9% 3P-R and a below average 27.5% 3P%. 
                    Very good at getting to the foul line with a 63.1% FT-R (93rd percentile) but struggles to convert while he‚Äôs there shooting only 62.3% from the stripe (25th percentile). 
                    Things to Consider:
                    What can we do to keep him off of the foul line or are we ok with putting him there because of his low percentage at the line? Especially in cutting situations which he is in 24% of the time.
                    What can we do to limit his activity on the backboard? Both offensively and defensively. 
                    Is he someone we are comfortable with baiting into shots from the perimeter because of his 27.5% 3p%?
