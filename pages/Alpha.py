FORMAT:
- Use ONLY bullet points, no subheadings or paragraphs.
- Each bullet point should be a single line, starting with "â€¢".
- Include 5-7 bullet points total.
- Use percentile rankings in parentheses where relevant.

CONTENT:
1. Usage and Overall Impact:
   â€¢ Comment on USG%, minutes per game, points per game, and shooting efficiency (eFG% or TS%).

2. Scoring Profile:
   â€¢ Compare 3P-R and 2P-R to determine primary shooting area and highlight relevant shooting percentage.
   â€¢ Identify play type with highest %Time and its PPP.

3. Rebounding:
   â€¢ Mention DRB if over 3 per game, ORB if over 1 per game. Always include overall Rebound %.

4. Playmaking (only if USG% > 10%):
   â€¢ Discuss assists and turnovers.

5. Defense:
   â€¢ Highlight steals or blocks only if in top 20 percentile and frequency is high.

6. Free Throw Shooting:
   â€¢ If over 2 FTA per game, mention FTA and FT%.

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
- High usage guard (26% USG, 91st percentile) plays 29.6 MPG, averages 11.3 PPG on 44.9% TS (21st percentile).
- Primary scorer inside arc (77.3% 2P-R), shoots 45.1% on 2-pointers.
- Most effective as P&R Ball Handler (24% of possessions, 0.678 PPP).
- Above-average rebounder: 3.8 RPG, 8.4% TRB%.
- Playmaking: 4.2 APG, 2.9 TO (AST% 27.9%, 96th; TO% 18.6%, 25th percentile).
- Gets to line frequently: 4.3 FTA per game, converts at 78.6% (71st percentile).
