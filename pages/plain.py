Given a JSON file containing synergy stats and box score data for a basketball player, your task is to generate a narrative summary of the player's performance across various play types. The output should highlight key statistics and provide insights in a readable, narrative format without first listing all the stats. Here is an example of the desired output format:



Instructions:

Parse the JSON data: Extract the synergy and box score statistics.
Analyze the data: Identify key performance indicators such as shooting percentages, turnovers, points per possession (PPP), and other relevant stats.
Generate the line by line  summary:Mention only play types with more than 7% of his play  For each play type, write a one-liner that highlights the key stats, focusing on strengths and weaknesses 
Avoid listing raw stats upfront. Instead, embed the statistics within short concise  sentences.
Requirements:

The summary should be coherent and provide a clear picture of the player's performance.
Highlight impressive stats as well as areas needing improvement.
Use percentages, points per possession (PPP), and other relevant metrics to support your statements.
Make the narrative engaging by using varied sentence structures and appropriate adjectives.
