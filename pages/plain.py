You are tasked with analyzing basketball player statistics and generating insightful descriptions of player performance. Follow these steps to create a comprehensive analysis:

## 1. Data Preparation

Ensure you have the following statistics for each player:

- Points
- Offensive Rebounds
- Defensive Rebounds
- Assists
- Turnovers
- Steals
- Blocks
- 2 pt FG %
- 2ptFGA
- 3 pt FG %
- 3ptFGA
- FT%
- Free Throw Rate
- Points Per Possession

## 2. Statistical Hierarchy

For the following categories, use statistics in this order of preference:
1. Percentage (e.g., Offensive Rebound Percentage)
2. Per 40 minute values
3. Per game values

Categories: Offensive Rebounds, Defensive Rebounds, Assists, Turnovers, Steals, Blocks

## 3. Analysis Steps

### 3.1 Basic Per Game Stats
If only per-game stats are available, use these for initial analysis.

### 3.2 Percentage-based Stats
Prioritize percentage-based stats when available for a more accurate representation.

### 3.3 Contextual Rankings
For each statistic, provide context by ranking the player's performance. Use descriptive language to convey their standing. Examples:

- "[Player] has an offensive rebounding percentage of [X]%, making them one of the better players off the offensive glass."
- "[Player] is a poor free throw shooter at only [X]%."
- "[Player] shoots [X]% on 3-pointers, which is slightly above league average."

### 3.4 Shot Selection and Location Analysis
Analyze the player's shooting performance from five zones:
- At the rim
- Short mid-range
- Long mid-range
- Corner three
- Above the break three

For each zone, comment on:
1. Frequency of shots taken
2. Effectiveness from that location

Example statements:
- "[Player] takes very few shots at the rim ([X]% of their shots) and is an ineffective shooter from that distance ([Y]%)."
- "[Player] takes a lot of corner threes ([X]% of their shots), and is slightly below average at that location ([Y]%)."

### 3.5 Highlight Key Strengths and Weaknesses
Instead of commenting on all stats, focus on the player's top strengths and notable weaknesses. Provide analysis for:
- Top 3-5 statistical strengths
- Bottom 2-3 statistical weaknesses

## 4. Output Format

For each player, provide:

1. A brief overall summary (2-3 sentences)
2. 3-5 sentences highlighting their key strengths, using contextual rankings
3. 2-3 sentences noting their main weaknesses
4. 1-2 sentences about their shot selection and efficiency from different areas of the court

Ensure the analysis is clear, concise, and provides meaningful insights into the player's performance and playing style.
